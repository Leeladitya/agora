  "description": "A monitoring AI flags an incoming nuclear strike with 87% confidence. Simultaneously, the facility's network shows indicators of a sophisticated cyber intrusion. The CISO must decide whether the alert is real or a deepfake injection — and the argumentation framework shifts with each second of new evidence.",

  "context": {
    "setting": "National defense monitoring facility. AI-augmented early warning system processes satellite, radar, and signals intelligence. Normal false positive rate: 0.01%. Current staffing: skeleton crew (3 AM local time). Secondary verification systems partially offline for scheduled maintenance.",
    "trigger": "AI system reports 87% confidence of inbound ICBM launch from adversary nation. Simultaneously, SOC detects anomalous network packets consistent with APT-level intrusion on the sensor fusion pipeline. The two events occurring together has a prior probability of < 0.0001%.",
    "stakes": "If the alert is real and ignored: catastrophic loss of life. If the alert is a cyber-induced false positive and escalated: potential retaliatory strike triggering nuclear exchange. If the CISO delays for more information: window for defensive action narrows.",
    "time_pressure": "Estimated 12 minutes from detection to impact if real. Network forensics require minimum 20 minutes for confident attribution. Decision must be made with fundamentally incomplete information.",
    "information_quality": "HIGH confidence: AI detection alert exists. MEDIUM confidence: cyber intrusion indicators. LOW confidence: whether intrusion has compromised sensor data. UNKNOWN: adversary intent, whether maintenance window was targeted."
