# AGORA Community Governance

## How We Reason Together

AGORA practices what it preaches. The project itself is governed through the same principles it implements: transparent argumentation, collective reasoning, and decisions that can be audited and challenged.

## Decision-Making

Major decisions about AGORA's direction — new features, architectural changes, community policies — are made through open discussion in GitHub Issues and Discussions. Anyone can propose, anyone can argue, and the reasoning must be explicit.

We don't vote on technical decisions. We argue them. The strongest reasoning wins, not the loudest voice or the most popular position. This is the Agora way.

## Roles

**Contributors** — anyone who submits code, scenarios, frameworks, documentation, or constructive feedback. No application needed. Show up with good reasoning.

**Scenario Reviewers** — experienced contributors who review Arena scenario submissions. Earned by contributing 3+ accepted scenarios or significant engine contributions.

**Core Maintainers** — stewards of the codebase and community standards. Responsible for merging PRs, maintaining CI/CD, and ensuring the project's intellectual integrity.

## Code of Conduct

The ancient Agora had one rule: argue in good faith. We extend that to:

1. **Argue the position, not the person.** Attack ideas, not contributors.
2. **Show your reasoning.** Assertions without argument carry no weight.
3. **Steelman, don't strawman.** Present the strongest version of opposing views.
4. **Welcome newcomers.** Every expert was once a beginner. The Agora's strength is its openness.
5. **Respect the traditions.** When engaging with Vedic, Confucian, Islamic, or Western frameworks, approach them with intellectual respect and genuine curiosity.
6. **Admit uncertainty.** "I don't know" is a valid and respected position.

## Conflict Resolution

When community members disagree about project direction, we practice what we build: structured argumentation. Each side presents their case with explicit reasoning. The community weighs the arguments. If consensus cannot be reached, core maintainers make a decision and publish their reasoning in full.

Every governance decision is logged, just like every engine decision. The community can always audit how and why a choice was made.

## Intellectual Property

Code contributions are MIT licensed. Scenario and framework contributions are CC-BY-SA 4.0. By contributing, you agree to these terms.

Contributors retain credit for their work. AGORA will never obscure attribution.
